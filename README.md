# predicting-credit-risk

## Goal
This script works to create two supervised machine learning models for predicting credit risk when given specific data. The data supplied was the loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income ratio, the number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt.

## Organization
The script was divided into sections, with each dedicated to separate functions (IE importing and preparing data, training models, testing models, and predicting with the model). Two functions were made to minimize code duplication.

## Execution
The script runs without issue, however the results are not as conclusive as I'd perfer. The training and testing are effectively the same. But the accuracy showed an approximate 10% difference between the Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier algorithms.
